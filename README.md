# Ajay's Tech Series üöÄ

Welcome! I'm Ajay, a backend engineer with a decade of experience building and scaling software. This repository is the central hub for my technical series, where I break down complex software engineering concepts. My goal is to share practical knowledge that you can apply directly to your work.

Whether you're designing distributed systems or want to master a specific technology, you'll find something valuable here.
